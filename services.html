			<h1>How Can We Help?</h1>
		</div>
		<div class='column width65'>
			<h3>Cultural Drift</h3>
			<p>When your organization doubles in size things get fuzzy. That tight-knit work family who could finish each other's sentences morphs into an awkward social group that doesn’t agree on how the work should get done. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>Piece-meal Training</h3>
			<p>Until now, sales training has been the side job of a cross-section marketing, product, HR, and even IT. Those people are now busy scaling their own departments. The head of sales is out closing the big deals. Training sputters. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>You Promised What?!</h3>
			<p>Reps that are onboarded too quickly don’t gain the knowledge and perspective they need to properly manage client expectations. As the product grows and changes they need to be kept in the loop. Without that, bad promises get made. Clients are disappointed. Sales suffer.</p>
			<h3>Drowning In Documents</h3>
			<p>Slide decks, territory maps, training videos, demo scripts, product specs… 6 months ago they were brand new. Now they’re out of date and piling up. Reps can’t find what they need when they need it and stick to the out of date stuff that they already know. Sales suffer.</p>

			<h1>How We Work</h1>
		</div>
		<div class='column width65'>
			<ul>
			<li><b>Weekly Sprints:</b> We define the work on Monday and we ship on Friday, week in and week out. All our work is tracked in Trello and completely transparent to you. You know exactly what’s happening at any time.</li>
			<li><b>Levels of Engagement:</b> Within our cadence of weekly sprints, you can tweak the level of engagement from 20% to 100% depending on your need. 20% engagements still ship every Friday, they just don’t ship as much stuff as a 100% engagement.</li>
			<li><b>Prototype and Iterate:</b> We believe in small experiments and constant course correction. Each sprint is based on the last and we are constantly learning. If you love detailed project plans you might be a little uncomfortable with how we operate.</li>
			<li><b>Gradual Release Of Responsibility:</b> We design self-sustaining systems, i.e. we work ourselves out of a job. As the learning system and culture takes hold we gradually remove ourselves and build capacity with internal champions.</li>
			</ul>
